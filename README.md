Description:Resume Matching Algorithm for Job descriptions

Introduction:
HR organizations generally need to skim through hundreds of Resumes to identify the resumes for any Job description. It used to be a herculent manual task before the invasion of Automation to identify the key words in Resumes. As we advance technologically, Machine Learning gave an opportunity to identify the suitable resumes in a more intelligent way. Natural Language Processing techniques, which are used to identify semantic and syntatic similarities in the text data paved a new way for the Resume Matching process.
